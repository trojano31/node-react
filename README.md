# Welcome to KOIA Soft FE Tech Interview
Thank you for being so interested in our job offer. We would like to make the whole process go smoothly, efficiently and even for all the candidates, and that is 
why we have prepared this for you.

## The tasks

We have prepared two technical tasks for you. Depending on your level, they should take between 90 and 180 minutes.

### Coding

In `fe-coding-task`, You will find a simple application with some additional libraries that we would like you to use, so you will not have to spend time configuring the basics. Please check *INSTRUCTION.md* for detailed instructions for the task. 

### Review

In the `fe-code-review` directory, you will find a file with a sample code. Please act like you were on the pull request review process with your colleagues, and this is the code they want to `merge with main`. Write all of your comments that you think are relevant to this code. Please note that we don't expect you to comment on all lines in the code. :)

You can put comments in the file or create a pull request within your repository and share comments there.

## How to send results

Please download this repository (f.e. Zip file). Next, please make your own **git repository** and upload your files there. 

### Optional ###
You can connect your repository with Vercel and share your coding task there. It's a nice addon that takes a few minutes.

### Questions ###

We didn't provide all the details in our tech task. And this is why we allow you to propose a solution, simplifying things, etc. But please be sure that we will ask you why you have done it. However, if you still have questions, we are happy to answer them. We know that proper coding starts with questions. 

# Good luck
